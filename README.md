# FastBrowser

**FastBrowser** is a lightweight and optimized browser designed for use on low-end devices. The goal of the project is to provide users with a fast, minimalist browser with essential features such as tab support, ad blocking, and a user-friendly interface for easy navigation. **FastBrowser** uses **Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)** for rendering pages, which allows for high performance with lower resource consumption compared to standard browsers like Chrome or Firefox.

## Key Features:
- Lightweight and fast interface.
- Tab support.
- Built-in ad blocker.
- Minimal system resource usage.
- Simple and intuitive interface for users.

## Tech Stack:
- **Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)** — for rendering web pages.
- **Qt/GTK** — for building the graphical user interface.
- **C++** — the primary programming language.
- **Adblock** — for ad blocking.

## Project Goal:
To create a browser that runs well on low-end devices while still providing a comfortable web browsing experience. We focus on minimalism and optimization to give users a fast solution for web surfing.
